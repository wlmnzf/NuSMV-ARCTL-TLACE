NuSMV-ARCTL-TLACE is a modified version of NuSMV 2.2.2 (http://nusmv.fbk.eu/).  NuSMV 2.2.2 has been extended with two new functionalities.

The first extension is the model checking of ARCTL, an extension of CTL including actions.  It has been mainly implemented by Franco Raimondi.  He has implemented the model checking algorithms. Jos√© Vander Meulen has then implemented the generation of counterexamples of ARCTL specifications.

The second extension is the generation of enriched counterexamples: tree-like annotated counterexamples (TLACEs), implemented by Simon Busard.

The provided version is a merge of the two extensions.  First, it allows to model check ARCTL specifications over SMV models, then it allows to generate TLACEs explaining why an (AR)CTL specification is not satisfied by a given model.

ARCTL
-----

Some information about the model checking of ARCTL can be found in the ARCTL/ directory. This directory contains a short document explaining what has been done and a CHANGELOG containing all the changes made to the initial version of NuSMV 2.2.2 by F. Raimondi.

Some examples of model checking of ARCTL can be found in ARCTL/examples.
