\begin{nusmvCommand}{process\_model} {Performs the batch steps and then returns control to the interactive shell.}

\cmdLine{process\_model [-h] [-i model-file] [-m Method]}

Reads the model, compiles it into BDD and performs the model checking
of all the specification contained in it. If the environment variable
\envvar{forward\_search} has been set before, then the set of
reachable states is computed. If the environment variables
\envvar{enable\_reorder} and \envvar{reorder\_method} are set, then
the reordering of variables is performed accordingly. This command
simulates the batch behavior of \nusmv and then returns the control to
the interactive shell.

\begin{cmdOpt}
 
\opt{-i \parameter{\filename{model-file}}}{Sets the environment variable
\envvar{input\_file} to file \filename{model-file}, and reads the
model from file \filename{model-file}.}
 
\opt{-m \parameter{\set{Method}{Monolithic, Threshold, Iwls95CP}}}{Sets the environment variable
\envvar{partition\_method} to \code{Method} and uses it as
partitioning method.}

\end{cmdOpt}
