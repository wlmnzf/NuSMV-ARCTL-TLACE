\begin{nusmvCommand} {go\_bmc} {Initializes the system for the BMC verification.}

\cmdLine{go\_bmc [-h]}

This command initializes the system for verification. It is equivalent
to the command sequence \command{read\_model},
\command{flatten\_hierarchy}, \command{encode\_variables}, \linebreak
\command{build\_boolean\_model}, \command{bmc\_setup}.  If some
commands have already been executed, then only the remaining ones will
be invoked.
