\begin{nusmvCommand} {go} {Initializes the system for the verification.}

\cmdLine{go [-h]}

This command initializes the system for verification. It is equivalent
to the command sequence \command{read\_model},
\command{flatten\_hierarchy}, \command{encode\_variables}, \linebreak
\command{build\_model}, \command{build\_flat\_model},
\command{build\_boolean\_model}.  If some commands have already been
executed, then only the remaining ones will be invoked.

\end{nusmvCommand}
