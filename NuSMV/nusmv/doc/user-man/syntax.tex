We present now the complete syntax of the input language of \nusmv. In
the following, an atom may be any sequence of characters starting with
a character in the set \code{\{A-Za-z\_\}} and followed by a possibly
empty sequence of characters belonging to the set
\code{\{A-Z\linebreak[0]a-z\linebreak[0]0-9\linebreak[0]\_\$\#-$\backslash$\}}.
A number is any sequence of digits. A digit belongs to the set
\code{\{0-9\}}.

All characters and case in a name are significant. Whitespace
characters are space (\spc), tab (\tab) and newline (\ret). Any string
\index{comments in \nusmv language} starting with two dashes
(`\code{--}') and ending with a newline is a comment. Any other tokens
recognized by the parser are enclosed in quotes in the syntax
expressions below. Grammar productions enclosed in square brackets
(`\code{[]}') are optional.


\section{Expressions}
\label{expressions}
\index{ expressions}
\index{expressions}
%
Expressions are constructed from variables, constants, and a
collection of operators, including boolean connectives, integer
arithmetic operators, case expressions and set expressions.

\subsection{Simple Expressions}
\label{simple expressions}
\index{simple expressions}
%
Simple expressions are expressions built only from current state
variables. Simple expressions can be used to specify sets of states,
e.g. the initial set of states. The syntax of simple expressions is as
follows:
%
\begin{Grammar}
simple_expr ::
          atom                           ;; a symbolic constant
        | number                         ;; a numeric constant
        | "TRUE"                         ;; The boolean constant 1
        | "FALSE"                        ;; The boolean constant 0
        | var_id                         ;; a variable identifier
        | "(" simple_expr ")"
        | "!" simple_expr                ;; logical not
        | simple_expr "\&" simple_expr    ;; logical and
        | simple_expr "|" simple_expr    ;; logical or
        | simple_expr "xor" simple_expr  ;; logical exclusive or
        | simple_expr "->" simple_expr   ;; logical implication
        | simple_expr "<->" simple_expr  ;; logical equivalence
        | simple_expr "=" simple_expr    ;; equality
        | simple_expr "!=" simple_expr   ;; inequality
        | simple_expr "<" simple_expr    ;; less than
        | simple_expr ">" simple_expr    ;; greater than
        | simple_expr "<=" simple_expr   ;; less than or equal
        | simple_expr ">=" simple_expr   ;; greater than or equal
        | simple_expr "+" simple_expr    ;; integer addition
        | simple_expr "-" simple_expr    ;; integer subtraction
        | simple_expr "*" simple_expr    ;; integer multiplication
        | simple_expr "/" simple_expr    ;; integer division
        | simple_expr "mod" simple_expr  ;; integer remainder
        | set_simple_expr                ;; a set simple_expression
        | case_simple_expr               ;; a case expression
\end{Grammar}
%
A \dfn{var\_id}, (see \sref{Identifiers}) or identifier, is a symbol
or expression which identifies an object, such as a variable or a
defined symbol. Since a \code{var\_id} can be an \code{atom}, there is
a possible ambiguity if a variable or defined symbol has the same name
as a symbolic constant. Such an ambiguity is flagged by the
interpreter as an error.

The order of parsing precedence for operators from high to low is:
%
\begin{Grammar}
*,/
+,-
mod
=,!=,<,>,<=,>=
|,xor
<->
->
\end{Grammar}
%
Operators of equal precedence associate to the left, except \code{->}
that associates to the right.  Parentheses may be used to group
expressions.

\subsubsection{Case Expressions}
\label{case expressions}
\index{ case expressions}
A case expression has the following syntax:
\begin{Grammar}
case_simple_expr ::
          "case"
             simple_expr ":" simple_expr ";"
             simple_expr ":" simple_expr ";"
             ...
             simple_expr ":" simple_expr ";"
          "esac"
\end{Grammar}
%
A \code{case\_simple\_expr} returns the value of the first expression
on the right hand side of `\code{:}', such that the corresponding
condition on the left hand side evaluates to \code{1}. Thus, if
\code{simple\_expr} on the left side is true, then the result is the
corresponding \code{simple\_expr} on the right side. If none of the
expressions on the left hand side evaluates to \code{1}, the result of
the \code{case\_expression} is the numeric value \code{1}. It is an
error for any expression on the left hand side to return a value other
than the truth values \code{0} or \code{1}.

\subsubsection{Set Expressions}
\label{set expressions}
\index{ set expressions}
\index{set expressions}
%
A set expression has the following syntax:
%
\begin{Grammar}
set_expr ::
            "\{" set_elem "," ... "," set_elem "\}" ;; set definition
         |  simple_expr "\code{in}" simple_expr       ;; set inclusion test
         |  simple_expr "\code{union}" simple_expr    ;; set union
set_elem :: simple_expr
\end{Grammar}
%
A set can be defined by enumerating its elements inside curly braces
`\{\ldots\}'. The inclusion operator `\code{in}' tests a value for
membership in a set. The union operator `\code{union}' takes the union
of two sets. If either argument is a number or a symbolic value
instead of a set, it is coerced to a singleton set.

\subsection{Next Expressions}
\label{Next Expressions}
\index{Next Expressions}
\index{next expressions}
%
While simple expressions can represent sets of states, next expressions
relate current and next state variables to express transitions in the
FSM.  The structure of next expressions is similar to the
structure of simple expressions (See \sref{simple expressions}). The
difference is that next expression allow to refer to next state
variables. The grammar is depicted below.
%
\begin{Grammar}
next_expr ::
          atom                        ;; a symbolic constant
        | number                      ;; a numeric constant
        | "TRUE"                      ;; The boolean constant 1
        | "FALSE"                     ;; The boolean constant 0
        | var_id                      ;; a variable identifier
        | "(" next_expr ")"
        | "next" "(" simple_expr ")"  ;; next value of an "expression"
        | "!" next_expr               ;; logical not
        | next_expr "&" next_expr     ;; logical and
        | next_expr "|" next_expr     ;; logical or
        | next_expr "xor" next_expr   ;; logical exclusive or
        | next_expr "->" next_expr    ;; logical implication
        | next_expr "<->" next_expr   ;; logical equivalence
        | next_expr "=" next_expr     ;; equality
        | next_expr "!=" next_expr    ;; inequality
        | next_expr "<" next_expr     ;; less than
        | next_expr ">" next_expr     ;; greater than
        | next_expr "<=" next_expr    ;; less than or equal
        | next_expr ">=" next_expr    ;; greater than or equal
        | next_expr "+" next_expr     ;; integer addition
        | next_expr "-" next_expr     ;; integer subtraction
        | next_expr "*" next_expr     ;; integer multiplication
        | next_expr "/" next_expr     ;; integer division
        | next_expr "mod" next_expr   ;; integer remainder
        | set_next_expr               ;; a set next_expression
        | case_next_expr              ;; a case expression
\end{Grammar}
%
\code{set\_next\_expr} and \code{case\_next\_expr} are the same as
\code{set\_simple\_expr} (see \sref{set expressions}) and
\code{case\_simple\_expr} (see \sref{case expressions}) respectively,
with the replacement of "\code{simple}" with "\code{next}".  The only
additional production is \code{"next" "(" simple\_expr ")"}, which
allows to ``shift'' all the variables in \code{simple\_expr} to the
\emph{next} state. The \code{next} operator distributes on every
operator. For instance, the formula \code{next((A \& B) | C)} is a
shorthand for the formula \code{(next(A) \& next(B)) | next(C)}. It is
an error if in the scope of the \code{next} operator occurs another
\code{next} operator.

\section{Definition of the FSM}
\subsection{State Variables}
\label{state variables}
\index{state variables syntax}
\index{\code{VAR} declaration}
%
A state of the model is an assignment of values to a set of state
variables. These variables (and also instances of modules) are
declared by the notation:
%
\begin{Grammar}
var_declaration :: "\code{VAR}"
             atom ":" type ";"
             atom ":" type ";"
             ...
\end{Grammar}
%
The type associated with a variable declaration can be either a
boolean, a scalar, a user defined module, or an array of any of these
(including arrays of arrays).

\subsubsection{Type Specifiers}
\label{type specifiers}
\index{type specifiers}
\index{type declaration}
%
A type specifier has the syntax:
%
\begin{Grammar}
type :: \code{boolean}
     |  "\{" val "," val "," ... val "\}"
     |  number ".." number
     |  "\code{array}" number ".." number "\code{of}" type
     |  atom [ "(" simple_expr "," simple_expr "," ...  ")" ]
     |  "\code{process}" atom [ "(" simple_expr "," ... "," simple_expr ")" ]
val  :: atom
     |  number
\end{Grammar}
%
A variable of type \code{boolean} can take on the numerical values
\code{0} and \code{1} (representing false and true, respectively). In
the case of a list of values enclosed in quotes (where atoms are taken
to be symbolic constants), the variable is a scalar which take any of
these values. In the case of an \code{array} declaration, the first
\code{simple\_expr} is the lower bound on the subscript and the second
\code{simple\_expr} is the upper bound. Both of these expressions must
evaluate to integer constants. Finally, an atom optionally followed by
a list of expressions in parentheses indicates an instance of module
atom (see \sref{MODULE declarations}). The keyword causes the module
to be instantiated as an asynchronous process (see \sref{processes}).

\subsection{Input Variables}
\label{input variables}
\index{input variables syntax}
\index{\code{IVAR} declaration}
%
\code{IVAR} (input variables) are used to label transitions of the Finite
State Machine.  The syntax for the declaration of input variables is
the following:
%
\begin{Grammar}
ivar_declaration :: "\code{IVAR}"
             atom ":" type ";"
             atom ":" type ";"
             ...
\end{Grammar}
%
The type associated with a variable declaration can be either a
boolean, a scalar, a user defined module, or an array of any of these
(including arrays of arrays) (see \sref{state variables}).

\subsection{\code{ASSIGN} declarations}
\label{ASSIGN declarations}
%
An assignment  has the form:
%
\begin{Grammar}
assign_declaration :: "\code{ASSIGN}"
           assign_body ";"
           assign_body ";"
           ...
assign_body ::
    atom                ":=" simple_expr     ;; normal assignment
  | "init" "(" atom ")" ":=" simple_expr     ;; init assignment
  | "next" "(" atom ")" ":=" next_expr       ;; next assignment
\end{Grammar}
%
On the left hand side of the assignment, atom denotes the current
value of a variable, `init(atom)' denotes its initial value, and
`next(atom)' denotes its value in the next state.  If the expression
on the right hand side evaluates to an integer or symbolic constant,
the assignment simply means that the left hand side is equal to the
right hand side.  On the other hand, if the expression evaluates to a
set, then the assignment means that the left hand side is contained in
that set. It is an error if the value of the expression is not
contained in the range of the variable on the left hand side.

In order for a program to be implementable, there must be some order
in which the assignments can be executed such that no variable is
assigned after its value is referenced. This is not the case if there
is a circular dependency among the assignments in any given
process. Hence, such a condition is an error. It is also an error for
a variable to be assigned more than once at any given time. More
precisely, it is an error if any of the following occur:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item the next or current value of a variable is assigned more than once
      in a given process
\item the initial value of a variable is assigned more than once in the
      program
\item the current value and the initial value of a variable are both
      assigned in the program
\item the current value and the next value of a variable are both
      assigned in the program
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\code{TRANS} declarations}
\label{TRANS declarations}
\index{ TRANS declarations}
%
The transition relation $R$ of the model is a set of current
state/next state pairs. Whether or not a given pair is in this set is
determined by a boolean valued expression $T$, introduced by the
`TRANS' keyword. The syntax of a \code{TRANS} declaration is:
%
\begin{Grammar}
trans_declaration :: "\code{TRANS}" trans_expr [";"]
trans_expr        :: next_expr
\end{Grammar}
%
It is an error for the expression to yield any value other than \code{0}
or \code{1}. If there is more than one \code{TRANS} declaration, the
transition relation is the conjunction of all of \code{TRANS}
declarations.

\subsection{\code{INIT} declarations}
\label{INIT declaration}
\index{ INIT declaration}
%
The set of initial states of the model is determined by a boolean
expression under the `INIT' keyword. The syntax of a \code{INIT}
declaration is:
%
\begin{Grammar}
init_declaration :: "\code{INIT}" init_expr [";"]
init_expr        :: simple_expr
\end{Grammar}
%
It is an error for the expression to contain the \code{next()}
operator, or to yield any value other than \code{0} or \code{1}. If
there is more than one \code{INIT} declaration, the initial set is the
conjunction of all of the \code{INIT} declarations.

\subsection{\code{INVAR} declarations}
\label{INVAR declaration}
\index{INVAR declaration}
%
The set of invariant states (i.e. the analogous of normal assignments,
as described in \sref{ASSIGN declarations}) can be specified using a
boolean expression under the `\code{INVAR}' keyword. The syntax of a
\code{INVAR} declaration is:
%
\begin{Grammar}
invar_declaration :: "\code{INVAR}" invar_expr [";"]
invar_expr        :: simple_expr
\end{Grammar}
%
It is an error for the expression to contain the \code{next()}
operator, or to yield any value other than \code{0} or \code{1}. If
there is more than one \code{INVAR} declaration, the invariant set is
the conjunction of all of the \code{INVAR} declarations.

\subsection{\code{DEFINE} declarations}
\label{DEFINE declarations}
\index{DEFINE declarations}
%
In order to make descriptions more concise, a symbol can be associated
with a commonly expression. The syntax for this kind of declaration
is:
%
\begin{Grammar}
define_declaration :: "\code{DEFINE}"
                    atom ":=" simple_expr ";"
                    atom ":=" simple_expr ";"
                    ...
                    atom ":=" simple_expr ";"
\end{Grammar}
%
Whenever an identifier referring to the symbol on the left hand side
of the \code{`:='} in a \code{DEFINE} occurs in an expression, it is
replaced by the expression on the right hand side. The expression on
the right hand side is always evaluated in its context (see
\sref{MODULE declarations} for an explanation of contexts). Forward
references to defined symbols are allowed, but circular definitions
are not allowed, and result in an error.

It is not possible to assign values to defined symbols
non-deterministically. Another difference between defined symbols and
variables is that while variables are statically typed, definitions
are not.

\subsection{\code{ISA} declarations}
\label{ISA declarations}
\index{ISA declarations}
%
There are cases in which some parts of a module could be shared among
different modules, or could be used as a module themselves. In \nusmv
it is possible to declare the common parts as separate modules, and
then use the \code{ISA} declaration to import the common parts inside
a module declaration. The syntax of an \code{ISA} declaration is as
follows:
%
\begin{Grammar}
isa_declaration :: "\code{ISA}" atom
\end{Grammar}
%
where \code{atom} must be the name of a declared module.  The
\code{ISA} declaration can be thought as a simple macro expansion
command, because the body of the module referenced by an \code{ISA}
command is replaced to the \code{ISA} declaration.

\subsection {\code{MODULE} declarations}
\label{MODULE declarations}
\index{MODULE declarations}
A module is an encapsulated collection of declarations. Once defined,
a module can be reused as many times as necessary. Modules can also be
so that each instance of a module can refer to different data
values. A module can contain instances of other modules, allowing a
structural hierarchy to be built. The syntax of a module declaration
is as follows.
%
\begin{Grammar}
module :: "\code{MODULE}" atom [ "(" atom "," atom "," ... atom ")" ]
          [ var_declaration        ]
          [ ivar_declaration       ]
          [ assign_declaration     ]
          [ trans_declaration      ]
          [ init_declaration       ]
          [ invar_declaration      ]
          [ spec_declaration       ]
          [ checkinvar_declaration ]
          [ ltlspec_declaration    ]
          [ compute_declaration    ]
          [ fairness_declaration   ]
          [ define_declaration     ]
          [ isa_declaration        ]
\end{Grammar}
%
The \emph{atom} immediately following the keyword "\code{MODULE}" is
the name associated with the module. Module names are drawn from a
separate name space from other names in the program, and hence may
clash with names of variables and definitions. The optional list of
atoms in parentheses are the formal parameters of the module. Whenever
these parameters occur in expressions within the module, they are
replaced by the actual parameters which are supplied when the module
is instantiated (see below).

An \emph{instance} of a module is created using the \code{VAR}
declaration (see \sref{state variables}). This declaration supplies a
name for the instance, and also a list of actual parameters, which are
assigned to the formal parameters in the module definition. An actual
parameter can be any legal expression. It is an error if the number of
actual parameters is different from the number of formal
parameters. The semantic of module instantiation is similar to
call-by-reference. For example, in the following program fragment:
%
\begin{nusmvCode}
MODULE main
...
 VAR
  a : boolean;
  b : foo(a);
...
MODULE foo(x)
 ASSIGN
   x := 1;
\end{nusmvCode}
%
the variable \code{a} is assigned the value \code{1}. This
distinguishes the call-by-reference mechanism from a call-by-value
scheme.

\noindent Now consider the following program:
%
\begin{nusmvCode}
MODULE main
...
 DEFINE
   a := 0;
 VAR
   b : bar(a);
...
MODULE bar(x)
 DEFINE
   a := 1;
   y := x;
\end{nusmvCode}
%
In this program, the value of \code{y} is \code{0}. On the other hand,
using a call-by-name mechanism, the value of \code{y} would be
\code{1}, since \code{a} would be substituted as an expression for
\code{x}.

\noindent Forward references to module names are allowed, but circular
references are not, and result in an error.

\subsection{Identifiers}
\label{Identifiers}
\index{ Identifiers}
%
An \code{id}, or identifier, is an expression which references an
object. Objects are instances of modules, variables, and defined
symbols. The syntax of an identifier is as follows.
%
\begin{Grammar}
id :: atom
    | "self"
    | id "." atom
    | id "[" simple_expr "]"
\end{Grammar}
%
An \emph{atom} identifies the object of that name as defined in a
\code{VAR} or \code{DEFINE} declaration. If \code{a} identifies an
instance of a module, then the expression `\code{a.b}' identifies
the component object named `\code{b}' of instance `\code{a}'. This
is precisely analogous to accessing a component of a structured data
type. Note that an actual parameter of module `\code{a}' can
identify another module instance `\code{b}', allowing `\code{a}'
to access components of `\code{b}', as in the following example:
%
\begin{nusmvCode}
MODULE main
...  VAR
  a : foo(b);
  b : bar(a);
...
MODULE foo(x)
 DEFINE
   c := x.p | x.q;
MODULE bar(x)
 VAR
   p : boolean;
   q : boolean;
\end{nusmvCode}
%
Here, the value of `\code{c}' is the logical or of `\code{p}' and
`\code{q}'.

\noindent If `\code{a}' identifies an array, the expression
`\code{a[b]}' identifies element `\code{b}' of array `\code{a}'. It is
an error for the expression `\code{b}' to evaluate to a number outside
the subscript bounds of array `\code{a}', or to a symbolic value.

It is possible to refer the name the current module has been
instantiated to by using the \code{self} builtin
identifier.\index{self}
%
\begin{nusmvCode}
MODULE element(above, below, token)
 VAR
   Token : boolean;
 ASSIGN
   init(Token) := token;
   next(Token) := token-in;
 DEFINE
   above.token-in := Token;
   grant-out := below.grant-out;
MODULE cell
 VAR
   e2 : element(self,   e1, 0);
   e1 : element(e1  , self, 1);
 DEFINE
   e2.token-in := token-in;
   grant-out := grant-in & !e1.grant-out;
MODULE main
 VAR c1 : cell;
\end{nusmvCode}
%
In this example the name the \code{cell} module has been instantiated
to is passed to the submodule \code{element}. In the \code{main}
module, declaring \code{c1} to be an instance of module \code{cell}
and defining \code{above.token-in} in module \code{e2}, really amounts
to defining the symbol \code{c1.token-in}. When you, in the
\code{cell} module, declare \code{e1} to be an instance of module
\code{element}, and you define \code{grant-out} in module \code{e1} to
be \code{below.grant-out}, you are really defining it to be the symbol
\code{c1.grant-out}.

\subsection{The \code{main} module}
\label{main module}
\index{ main module}
%
The syntax of a \nusmv program is:
%
\begin{Grammar}
program ::
        module_1
        module_2
        ...
        module_n
\end{Grammar}
%
There must be one module with the name \code{main} and no formal
parameters.  The module \code{main} is the one evaluated by the
interpreter.

\subsection{Processes}
\label{processes}
\index{process keyword}
\index{processes}
%
Processes are used to model interleaving concurrency. A \dfn{process}
is a module which is instantiated using the keyword `\code{process}'
(see \sref{state variables}). The program executes a step by
non-deterministically choosing a process, then executing all of the
assignment statements in that process in parallel. It is implicit that
if a given variable is not assigned by the process, then its value
remains unchanged. Each instance of a process has a special boolean
variable associated with it called
\code{running}.\index{\code{running}} The value of this variable is
\code{1} if and only if the process instance is currently selected for
execution.  A process may run only when its parent is running. In
addition no two processes with the same parents may be running at the
same time.

\subsection{\code{FAIRNESS} declarations}
\label{FAIRNESS declarations}
\index{\code{FAIRNESS} declarations}
\index{fairness constraints}
\index{justice constraints}
\index{compassion constraints}
\index{fairness constraints declaration}
\index{fair paths}
%
A fairness constraint restricts the attention only to \dfn{fair
execution paths}.  When evaluating specifications, the model checker
considers path quantifiers to apply only to fair paths.

\nusmv supports two types of fairness constraints, namely justice
constraints and compassion constraints.  A justice constraint consists
of a formula \code{f} which is assumed to be true infinitely often in
all the fair paths. In \nusmv justice constraints are identified by
keywords \code{JUSTICE} and, for backward compatibility,
\code{FAIRNESS}.  A compassion constraint consists of a pair of
formulas \code{(p,q)}; if property \code{p} is true infinitely often
in a fair path, then also formula \code{q} has to be true infinitely
often in the fair path. In \nusmv compassion constraints are
identified by keyword \code{COMPASSION}.\footnote{In the current
version of \nusmv, compassion constraints are supported only for
BDD-based LTL model checking. We plan to add support for compassion
constraints also for CTL specifications and in Bounded Model Checking
in the next releases of \nusmv.} If compassion constraints are used
then the model must not contain any input variables. Currently, \nusmv
does not enforce this so it is the responsibility of the user to make
sure that this is the case.

Fairness constraints are declared using the following syntax:
%
\begin{Grammar}
fairness_declaration :: 
       "\code{FAIRNESS}" simple_expr [";"]
     | "\code{JUSTICE}" simple_expr [";"]
     | "\code{COMPASSION}" "(" simple_expr "," simple_expr ")" [";"]
\end{Grammar}
%
A path is considered fair if and only if it satisfies all the
constraints declared in this manner.

\section{Specifications}
%
The specifications to be checked on the FSM can be expressed in two
different temporal logics: the Computation Tree Logic CTL, and the
Linear Temporal Logic LTL extended with Past Operators. It is also
possible to analyze quantitative characteristics of the FSM by
specifying real-time CTL specifications. Specifications can be
positioned within modules, in which case they are preprocessed to
rename the variables according to the containing context.

CTL and LTL specifications are evaluated by \nusmv in order to
determine their truth or falsity in the FSM. When a specification is
discovered to be false, \nusmv constructs and prints a counterexample,
i.e. a trace of the FSM that falsifies the property.

\subsection{CTL Specifications}
\label{CTL Specifications}
\index{ CTL Specifications}
%
A CTL specification is given as a formula in the temporal logic CTL,
introduced by the keyword `\code{SPEC}'. The syntax of this
declaration is:
%
\begin{Grammar}
spec_declaration :: "\code{SPEC}" spec_expr [";"]
spec_expr        :: ctl_expr
\end{Grammar}
%
The syntax of CTL formulas recognized by the \nusmv parser is
as follows:
%
\begin{Grammar}
ctl_expr ::
    simple_expr                 ;; a simple boolean expression
    | "(" ctl_expr ")"
    | "!" ctl_expr              ;; logical not
    | ctl_expr "&" ctl_expr     ;; logical and
    | ctl_expr "|" ctl_expr     ;; logical or
    | ctl_expr "xor" ctl_expr   ;; logical exclusive or
    | ctl_expr "->" ctl_expr    ;; logical implies
    | ctl_expr "<->" ctl_expr   ;; logical equivalence
    | "EG" ctl_expr             ;; exists globally
    | "EX" ctl_expr             ;; exists next state
    | "EF" ctl_expr             ;; exists finally
    | "AG" ctl_expr             ;; forall globally
    | "AX" ctl_expr             ;; forall next state
    | "AF" ctl_expr             ;; forall finally
    | "E" "[" ctl_expr "U" ctl_expr "]" ;; exists until
    | "A" "[" ctl_expr "U" ctl_expr "]" ;; forall until
\end{Grammar}
%
It is an error for an expressions in a CTL formula to contain a
`\code{next()}' operator, or to have non-boolean components, i.e.
subformulas which evaluate to a value other than \code{0} or \code{1}.

It is also possible to specify invariants, i.e. propositional formulas
which must hold invariantly in the model. The corresponding command is
`\code{INVARSPEC}', with syntax:
%
\begin{Grammar}
checkinvar_declaration :: "\code{INVARSPEC}" simple_expr ";"
\end{Grammar}
%
This statement corresponds to
%
\begin{Grammar}
SPEC  AG simple_expr ";"
\end{Grammar}
%
but can be checked by a specialized algorithm during reachability
analysis.

\subsection{LTL Specifications}
\label{LTL Specifications}
\index{LTL Specifications}
%
LTL specifications are introduced by the keyword ``\code{LTLSPEC}''. The syntax
of this declaration is:
%
\begin{Grammar}
ltlspec_declaration :: "\code{LTLSPEC}" ltl_expr [";"]
\end{Grammar}
%
where
\begin{Grammar}
ltl_expr ::
    simple_expr                ;; a simple boolean expression
    | "(" ltl_expr ")"
    | "!" ltl_expr             ;; logical not
    | ltl_expr "&" ltl_expr    ;; logical and
    | ltl_expr "|" ltl_expr    ;; logical or
    | ltl_expr "xor" ltl_expr  ;; logical exclusive or
    | ltl_expr "->" ltl_expr   ;; logical implies
    | ltl_expr "<->" ltl_expr  ;; logical equivalence
    ;; FUTURE
    | "X" ltl_expr             ;; next state
    | "G" ltl_expr             ;; globally
    | "F" ltl_expr             ;; finally
    | ltl_expr "U" ltl_expr    ;; until
    | ltl_expr "V" ltl_expr    ;; releases
    ;; PAST
    | "Y" ltl_expr             ;; previous state
    | "Z" ltl_expr             ;; not previous state not
    | "H" ltl_expr             ;; historically
    | "O" ltl_expr             ;; once 
    | ltl_expr "S" ltl_expr    ;; since
    | ltl_expr "T" ltl_expr    ;; triggered
\end{Grammar}
%
In \nusmv, LTL specifications can be analyzed both by means of
BDD-based reasoning, or by means of SAT-based bounded model
checking. In the first case, \nusmv proceeds along the lines described
in \cite{CGH97}. For each LTL specification, a tableau able to
recognize the behaviors falsifying the property is constructed, and
then synchronously composed with the model. With respect to
\cite{CGH97}, the approach is fully integrated within \nusmv, and
allows for full treatment of past temporal operators.  In the case of
BDD-based reasoning, the counterexample generated to show the falsity
of a LTL specification may contain state variables which have been
introduced by the tableau construction procedure.
%
In the second case, a similar tableau construction is carried out to
encode the existence of a path of limited length violating the
property. \nusmv generates a propositional satisfiability problem,
that is then tackled by means of an efficient SAT solver
\cite{BCCZ99}.
%
In both cases, the tableau constructions are completely transparent to
the user.

\subsection{Real Time CTL Specifications and Computations}
\label{Real Time CTL Specifications and Computations}
\index{ Real Time CTL Specifications and Computations}
\nusmv allows for Real Time CTL specifications
%
\cite{EMSS91}. \nusmv assumes that each transition takes unit time for
execution. RTCTL extends the syntax of CTL path expressions with the
following bounded modalities:
%
\begin{Grammar}
rtctl_expr ::
        ctl_expr
      | "EBF" range rtctl_expr
      | "ABF" range rtctl_expr
      | "EBG" range rtctl_expr
      | "ABG" range rtctl_expr
      | "A" "[" rtctl_expr "BU" range rtctl_expr "]"
      | "E" "[" rtctl_expr "BU" range rtctl_expr "]"
range  :: number ".." number"
\end{Grammar}
%
Intuitively, the semantics of the RTCTL operators is as follows:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item \code{EBF \textit{m}..\textit{n} \textit{p}}
        requires that there exists a path starting from a state, such
        that property \textit{p} holds in a future time instant
        \textit{i}, with $m \leq i \leq n$
  \item \code{ABF \textit{m}..\textit{n} \textit{p}}
        requires that for all paths starting from a state, property
        \textit{p} holds in a future time instant \textit{i}, with $m
        \leq i \leq n$
  \item \code{EBG \textit{m}..\textit{n} \textit{p}}
        requires that there exists a path starting from a state, such
        that property \textit{p} holds in all future time instants
        \textit{i}, with $m \leq i \leq n$
  \item \code{ABG \textit{m}..\textit{n} \textit{p}}
        requires that for all paths starting from a state, property
        \textit{p} holds in all future time instants \textit{i}, with
        $m \leq i \leq n$
  \item \code{E [ \textit{p} BU \textit{m}..\textit{n} \textit{q} ]}
        requires that there exists a path starting from a state, such
        that property \textit{q} holds in a future time instant
        \textit{i}, with $m \leq i \leq n$, and property \textit{p}
        holds in all future time instants \textit{j}, with $m \leq j <
        i$
  \item \code{A [ \textit{p} BU \textit{m}..\textit{n} \textit{q} ]},
        requires that for all paths starting from a state, property
        \textit{q} holds in a future time instant \textit{i}, with $m
        \leq i \leq n$, and property \textit{p} holds in all future
        time instants \textit{j}, with $m \leq j < i$
\end{itemize}
%
Real time CTL specifications can be defined with the following syntax,
which extends the syntax for CTL specifications.
%
\begin{Grammar}
spec_declaration :: "\code{SPEC}" rtctl_expr [";"]
\end{Grammar}
%
With the `\code{COMPUTE}' statement, it is also possible to compute
quantitative information on the FSM. In particular, it is possible to
compute the exact bound on the delay between two specified events,
expressed as CTL formulas. The syntax is the following:
%
\begin{Grammar}
compute_declaration :: "\code{COMPUTE}" compute_expr [";"]
\end{Grammar}
%
where
%
\begin{Grammar}
compute_expr :: "MIN" "[" rtctl_expr "," rtctl_expr "]"
              | "MAX" "[" rtctl_expr "," rtctl_expr "]"
\end{Grammar}
%
\code{MIN [\textit{start , final}]} computes the set of states
reachable from \textit{start}. If at any point, we encounter a state
satisfying \textit{final}, we return the number of steps taken to
reach the state. If a fixed point is reached and no states intersect
\textit{final} then \dfn{infinity} is returned.

\noindent \code{MAX [\textit{start , final}]} returns the length of
the longest path from a state in \textit{start} to a state in
\textit{final}. If there exists an infinite path beginning in a state
in \textit{start} that never reaches a state in \textit{final}, then
\textit{infinity} is returned.

\section{Variable Order Input}
%
It is possible to specify the order in which variables should appear
in the BDD's generated by \nusmv. The file which gives the desired
order can be read in using the \commandopt{i} option in batch mode or
by setting the \envvar{input\_order\_file} environment variable in
interactive mode.

\subsection{Input File Syntax}
\label{Input File Syntax}
\index{ Input File Syntax}
%
The syntax for input files describing the desired variable ordering is
as follows, where the file can be considered as a list of variable
names, each of which must be on a separate line:
%
\begin{Grammar}
vars_list :: EMPTY
           | var_list_item vars_list

var_list_item :: var_main_id
               | var_main_id.NUMBER

var_main_id :: ATOM
             | var_main_id[NUMBER]
             | var_main_id.var_id

var_id :: ATOM
        | var_id[NUMBER]
        | var_id.var_id
\end{Grammar}
%
That is, a list of variable names of the following forms:
%
\begin{Grammar}
Complete_Var_Name        - to specify an ordinary variable
Complete_Var_Name[index] - to specify an array variable element
Complete_Var_Name.NUMBER - to specify a specific bit of an encoded
                           scalar variable
\end{Grammar}
%
where \texttt{Complete\_Var\_Name} is just the name of the variable if
it appears in the module \texttt{MAIN}, otherwise it has the module
name(s) prepended to the start, for example:\\

\texttt{mod1.mod2...modN.varname}\\

\noindent where \texttt{varname} is a variable in \texttt{modN}, and
\texttt{modN.varname} is a variable in \texttt{modN-1}, and so
on. Note that the module name \texttt{main} is implicitely prepended
to every variable name and therefore must not be included in their
declarations.

\noindent Any variable which appears in the model file, but not the
ordering file is placed after all the others in the
ordering. Variables which appear in the ordering file but not the
model file are ignored. In both cases \nusmv displays a warning
message stating these actions.

Comments can be included by using the same syntax as regular \nusmv
files. That is, by starting the line with \texttt{--}.


\subsection{Scalar Variables}
\label{Scalar Variables}
\index{Scalar Variables}
%
A variable which has a finite range of values that it can take is
encoded as a set of boolean variables. These boolean variables
represent the binary equivalents of all the possible values for the
scalar variable. Thus, a scalar variable that can take values from 0
to 7 would require three boolean variables to represent it.

It is possible to not only declare the position of a scalar variable
in the ordering file, but each of the boolean variables which
represent it.

\noindent If only the scalar variable itself is named then all the
boolean variables which are actually used to encode it are grouped
together in the BDD. 

\noindent Variables which are grouped together will always remain next
to each other in the BDD and in the same order. When dynamic variable
re-ordering is carried out, the group of variables are treated as one
entity and moved as such.

\noindent If a scalar variable is omitted from the ordering file then
it will be added at the end of the variable order and the specific-bit
variables that represent it will be grouped together. However, if any
specific-bit variables have been declared in the ordering file (see
below) then these will not be grouped with the remaining ones.

\noindent It is also possible to specify that specific-bit variables
are placed elsewhere in the ordering. This is achieved by first
specifying the scalar variable name in the desired location, then
simply specifying \texttt{Complete\_Var\_Name.i} at the position where
you want that bit variable to appear:
%
\begin{Grammar}
...
Complete\_Var\_Name
...
Complete\_Var\_Name.i
...
\end{Grammar}
%
The result of doing this is that the variable representing the
\textit{$i^{th}$} bit is located in a different position to the
remainder of the variables representing the rest of the bits. The
specific-bit variables \textit{varname.0, ..., varname.i-1,
varname.i+1, ..., varname.N} are grouped together as before.

If any one bit occurs before the variable it belongs to, the remaining
specific-bit variables are not grouped together:
%
\begin{Grammar}
...
Complete\_Var\_Name.i
...
Complete\_Var\_Name
...
\end{Grammar}
%
The variable representing the \textit{$i^{th}$} bit is located at the
position given in the variable ordering and the remainder are located
where the scalar variable name is declared. In this case, the
remaining bit variables will not be grouped together.

\noindent This is just a short-hand way of writing each individual
specific-bit variable in the ordering file. The following are
equivalent:

\begin{small} 
\begin{tabular}{ll} \texttt{...} &
\texttt{...}\\ \texttt{Complete\_Var\_Name.0} &
\texttt{Complete\_Var\_Name.0}\\ \texttt{Complete\_Var\_Name.1} &
\texttt{Complete\_Var\_Name}\\ \texttt{:} & \texttt{...}\\
\texttt{Complete\_Var\_Name.N-1}\\ \texttt{...} &
\end{tabular}
\end{small}

\noindent where the scalar variable \texttt{Complete\_Var\_Name}
requires N boolean variables to encode all the possible values that it
may take.\\ \\ It is still possible to then specify other specific-bit
variables at later points in the ordering file as before.\\

\subsection{Array Variables}
\label{Array Variables}
\index{ Array Variables}

When declaring array variables in the ordering file, each individual
element must be specified separately. It is not permitted to specify
just the name of the array.\\
\\
The reason for this is that the actual definition of an array in the
model file is essentially a shorthand method of defining a list of
variables that all have the same type. Nothing is gained by declaring
it as an array over declaring each of the elements individually, and
there is no difference in terms of the internal representation of the
variables.
