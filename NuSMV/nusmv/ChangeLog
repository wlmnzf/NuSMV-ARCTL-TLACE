Thu 5 Aug 2004 09:46:34  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it> 
	* node/nodePrint.c: Added cases XOR and XNOR to print_sexp. 

Wed 4 Aug 2004 14:06:11   Andrey Tchaltsev <tchaltsev@irst.itc.it>  Gavin Keighren <keighren@irst.itc.it> 
	* docs/user-man/*: Added and fixed documentation.

Wed 4 Aug 2004 13:28:35  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it>
        * options -k and -l, if specified more than once, make nusmv emit an error 
          message and go back to the shell. 
        * checked the use of mutually exclusive options -v and -p in bmc_simulate.
        * Filename patterns like @@@@k are now correcly expanded as @@k. 
          Ahead of this fix, @k was expanded at first. 
        * When unknown options are used with bmc_simulate, the command execution 
          is now stopped.
        * Fixed unregistered traces in check_invar_bmc_inc and check_invar_bmc.
        * Other minor fixes.

Wed 4 Aug 2004 10:10:40  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it>
	* Factorized counterexample printing code in bmc
	* In bmc, during checking commands current bounds and the
	specification were printed out if neither counter-example nor
	proof was found. Now only bounds are printed out to provide feedback
	to users, and the specification text is printed only when the
	verbosity level is greater than two. 

Tue 3 Aug 2004 17:24:37  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it>
	* Fixed memory leaks in bmc.
	* Fixed a bug in BMC commands options handling. 

Tue 3 Aug 2004 14:23:51  Andrey Tchaltsev <tchaltsev@irst.itc.it>
	* New function in module 'be'. For a given be index the function
	returns an associated cnf index, and viceversa. 

Mon 2 Aug 2004 14:34:24  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it>  Gavin Keighren <keighren@irst.itc.it>
        * The tutorial contains now a section about complete invariant 
	checking.  
	* Fixed description of system variable 'ag_only_search' in the
	user manual.

Thu 29 Jul 2004 14:43:41  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it>
	* enc/symb/Encoding.c: Fixed a problem that occurred in bmc when
	determinization variables were introduced, and variable ordering
	file was used. 

Thu 29 Jul 2004 13:30:58  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it>
	* enc/symb/Encoding.{h,c}: Added method is_symbol_determ_var to
	class Encoding. 
	
Wed 28 Jul 2004 15:33:04  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it> 
	* bmc/*: Bug fix #275. Arrays variables are now allowed to occur in
	formulae, but only if they are boolean arrays. 

Wed 28 Jul 2004 11:31:53  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it> 
	* enc/symb/Encoding.c: Bug fix #273. When grouping variables,
	variables for determinization were missing. This made the encoding
	with ordering file possibly buggy. 
	
Tue 27 Jul 2004 12:12:11  Andrey Tchaltsev <tchaltsev@irst.itc.it> 
	* sat/* : Added support for incremental sat solvers.
	* bmc/* : Added algorithms for incremental bmc. 

Tue 27 Jul 2004 12:12:11  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it> 
	* bmc/*: Adapted non incremental bmc to the new sat interface.
	* bmc/*: Added een/sorensson algorithm for non incremental invar
 	checking.

Mon 19 Jul 2004 12:05:52  Marco Roveri <roveri@irst.itc.it>
	* mc/mcMc.c, ltl/ltl.c: fixed missing intersection with fair
	states before invoking counter-example extraction.

Mon 19 Jul 2004 11:54:09  Roberto Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it>
	* compile/compileFlatten.c: Fixed a bug that occurred when
	instantiating more than once a variable whose range contained one
	value only.
	
Thu 15 Jul 2004 15:52:54  Roveri <roveri@irst.itc.it> Cavada <cavada@irst.itc.it>
	* bmc/bmcConv.c: bexpr -> be conversion caches results. This makes
	convertion more efficient. 	

	
Wed 14 Jul 2004 14:11:47 Marco Roveri  <roveri@irst.itc.it>
	* bmc/bmcSat.c: Fixed wrong allocation when sat solvers but SIM
	were called 
	

Tue 13 Jul 2004 14:02:14 Roberto Cavada  <cavada@irst.itc.it>
	* sm/smMist.c: Fixed behaviour of option -r in batch mode
	

Wed 23 Jun 2004 12:00:00 Roberto Cavada  <cavada@irst.itc.it>
	* Released minor version 2.2.1

	
Mon 21 Jun 2004 16:16:51  Andrey TChaltsev <tchaltsev@irs.itc.it>  Cavada <cavada@irs.itc.it>
	* Added platform-dependant suffix when searching for executable
	files

	
Thu 17 Jun 2004 12:00:00 Roberto Cavada  <cavada@irst.itc.it>	
	* compile/compileFlatten.c: Fixed ordering of insertion of vars.
	
	* enc/bdd/BddEnc: Changed initial variables index: one instead of
	zero. This makes dynamic reordering fully working.

	* compile/compileFlatten.c: Fixed one-value range management.

	* examples/m4: Added m4 examples provided by Villemaire.

	* sm/smMisc.c: Realigned -o option behaviour wrt what version 2.1
	did. 


Tue 15 Jun 2004 09:59:53  Roberto Cavada  <cavada@irst.itc.it>
	* compile/compileCheck.c: Fixed missing type ARRAY when checking
	for input vars in assignements.
