02/08/2004: Changed sm/smMain.c (BannerPrint); changed parser/input.l 
(token TOK_EAX); changed parser/symbol.h (added EAX and increased TOK*MAX);
changed parser/grammar.y (TOK_EAX);
changed compile/compileFlatten.c (line 1592), to support EAX
changed compile/compileCone.c (line 575) to support EAX
disabled check in prop/PropDb.c (line 242): THIS *MUST* be reintroduced, by evaluating the expression.
in mc/mcMc.c, added function eax (lines 284-310)
in mc/mc.h, added line 73
in mc/mcEval.c, added line 228 (case EAX:...)

                        added case: at lines 372-380;
Added a few tests in nusmv/tests
